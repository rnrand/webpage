- **April 2022** I gave the keynote [Writing and Verifying a Quantum Optimizing Compiler](https://conf.researchr.org/details/CC-2022/CC-2022-research-papers/1/Writing-and-Verifying-a-Quantum-Optimizing-Compiler) at [Compiler Correctness 2022](https://conf.researchr.org/home/CC-2022). 
- **March 2022** The [Chicago Quantum Programming Languages Laboratory (ChiQP)](https://chiqp.cs.uchicago.edu/people/) now has its own website! Thanks to [Kartik Singhal](https://ks.cs.uchicago.edu/) for his hard work in setting this up. 
- **January 2022** Gave a talk at the Quantum Computing Center on [Quantum Programming Languages: What they are and what they could be](https://quantummeetups.org/event/towards-400-qubits-compilers-and-programming-quantum-applications/). Video to follow!
- **December 2021** Kartik's [Quantum PL & Verification Bibliography](https://quantumpl.github.io/bib/) now contains a quantum programming languages [pronunciation guide](https://quantumpl.github.io/bib/post/pronunciation-guide/)! Yes, [QISKIT is messing with you](https://bsiegelwax.medium.com/how-do-you-pronounce-qiskit-5d5df387e00).
- **October 2021** Held an [Ask Me Anything](https://2021.splashcon.org/details/splash-2021-ask-me-anything--ama-/3/Invited-Speaker) at SPLASH!
- **July 2021**: [PLanQC 2021](https://www.pldi21.org/track_planqc.html) was a tremendous success! Thanks to my coorganizers, Matt Amy and Ross Duncan, who helped put together such an amazing program, and to the organizers of PLDI 2021! And congrats to everyone (including my collaborators) who got to present!
- **March 2021**: Our [follow-up work](/publication/hietala-2021-proving/) to VOQC, demonstrating the power of the SQIR programming language and verification tool, was accepted to ITP 2021!
- **January 2021**: [VOQC](publication/hietala-2021-verified/) wins a Distinguished Paper award at POPL 2021! Write-ups by [UMD](https://www.cs.umd.edu/article/2021/01/umd-team-receive-distinguished-paper-award-popl-2021), [UChicago](https://www.cs.uchicago.edu/news/article/popl-compiler/), and us on the [SIGPLAN blog](https://blog.sigplan.org/2021/06/02/verifying-a-quantum-compiler/)!
