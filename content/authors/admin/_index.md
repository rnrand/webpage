I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science, part of the [Programming Languages Research Group](http://pl.cs.uchicago.edu/) and the [Chicago Quantum Exchange](https://quantum.uchicago.edu/).

My main interest is in applying techniques from programming languages and formal verification to the domain of quantum computation. Two of my main projects are the [QWIRE](https://github.com/inQWIRE/QWIRE/) quantum circuit language (with Jennifer Paykin) and the [VOQC](https://github.com/inQWIRE/SQIR/) verified optimizing compiler (with Kesha Hietala). I'm currently interested in verified optimization, error-correction, type systems and programming abstractions for quantum computing.

I'm working on a [book](vqc/index.html) on verified quantum programming! Email me if you'd like to use the book for your own course.

I'm currently looking for new students at all levels: [Please reach out!](mailto:rand@uchicago.edu)
